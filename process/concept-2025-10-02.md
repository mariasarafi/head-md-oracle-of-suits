## Research 
My research examines how <b>nature-themed playing cards</b>, especially those featuring <b>animal motifs</b>, have evolved across cultures and time periods (<i>[Nature - Bestiary Cards Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DHTS5pODCRAs6sN-34fva-bKjNU4pooS/view?usp=share_link)</i>). I focus primarily on

- the historical development of Japanese card games, tracing their origins from 8th-century precursors through to the emergence of 19th- and 20th-century Hanafuda decks with variations present also in Korea and Hawaii,
- the European card decks, with particular attention to the evolution of Tarot (Tarot de Marseille, Rider–Waite Tarot, and contemporary variations), especially the distinct designs and artwork of Major Arcana or Trump cards,
- animal-themed card games for children aged 6+

In parallel, I try to identify the <b>main patterns of card game mechanics</b> based on the above-researched games and my personal card game experience and observations. 

In addition, both <b>accessibility and ecological footprint</b> are important parameters for my project to consider.

### Insights - IN PROGRESS
1. Humans and Nature Early playing cards (China, India, and later Mamluk deck) often carried symbolic imagery, including birds, flowers, and animals, as they were easier to recognize across cultures and social classes. When cards spread to Europe in the 14th century, animals symbolized specific virtues, and fate. For example, lions represented strength, birds freedom or fate, snakes
deceit. In the 17th–18th centuries, educational and moral card games were common. Decks often depicted plants, animals, or natural scenes to teach children about zoology, botany, or moral lessons.

2. <b>Animal Symbolism and Cultural Representation.</b> While in Hanafuda decks there is a nature focused approach in representing nature and animals - there is only one card whith human presence - in the European decks the approach is more anthropocentric.

Animals in European cards are presented often as human companions or working animals, or are attributed specific anthropological characteristics or symbolic meaning.

Animals evoke emotions; for example, a fox is seen as cunning, while a dog is considered loyal. They can make a game more appealing not only aesthetically but also in terms of relatability. For instance, in modern trading card games, creatures inspired by real or mythical animals make the game more immersive and engaging. 

3. <b>Stop or Continue Concept.</b> Card game rules define when a player can continue playing in a specific round or has to stop. They also define when a game is considered completed. There are games where the player is the one choosing to stop and score, or continue and risk, like in Blackjack by hitting for an additional card or in Koi-Koi (the homonymous Japanese Hanafuda card game), by continuing playing (koi-koi).

4. <b>Accessibility.</b> Card games present various accessibility - inclusivity issues, which can affect players with visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, or motor challenges. In addition, as mentioned during the Museum of Games presentation accessibility has not been fully addressed.

5. <b>Ecological Footprint (EF).</b> To assess the environmental impact of a product or service based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, the environmental impact of a product or service is computed at each step of its life cycle (extraction of materials needed, manufacturing, distribution / transport to the customer, use, end of life) - See <i>[THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF VIDEO AND BOARD GAMES](https://gamelab-lausanne.ch/the-environmental-impact-of-video-and-board-games/#:~:text=Materials%20are%20needed%20to%20build,well%20as%20transmit%20the%20data.)</i>.

## Koi-Koi*

Koi-koi is an interactive experience where the player explores the history of animal- and nature-themed cards, including Hanafuda decks and their precursors, Tarot, standard decks, and children's card games. The player first selects three animal cards, each representing one of the primary animal environments: air, earth, and water. Next, the player chooses four plant cards, with one card representing each of the four seasons. These selections establish a 52-card deck and a player's profile. The three animal cards determine the "royal" figures, while the four seasonal plant cards set the four suits. Based on which cards the player selects and the extent to which they continue shuffling—risking less suitable draws—a personality and emotional profile is created, simulating Tarot mechanics.
