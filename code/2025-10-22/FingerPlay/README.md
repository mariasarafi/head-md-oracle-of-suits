# FingerPlay
It is an application of the Hand Demo.

I am displaying the finger points of the fingers I am using, thumb and index, and the connections of the hands, because I am using the hands.

- I am creating bubbles when the thumb and Index are touching 
- The bubbles explode when they touch, so sometimes they explode the moment they are created
- Moving the hands left and right I move the bubbles left and right

I made the video full screen so I started to have distortion issues, I had also to adapt the code for the connections and the finger points to adapt to the new size.

IMAGES TO BE ADDED. There is a video recording too.
