# FacePlay
It is an application of the Face Demo.

Following the color palette of the Face landmarks 
    - I am creating bubbles when the mouth is opened 
    - The bubbles explode when I close my eyes
    - I create stars when I smile
    - The stars explode when I close my eyes 

I removed the camera and kept only the face landmarks and the interaction result. 
The background is now black, I tried to add an image but I would have prefered to have a more interactive background.

IMAGES TO BE ADDED. There is a video recording too.
