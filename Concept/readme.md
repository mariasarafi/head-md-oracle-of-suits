## Suitscapes
<i>Suitscapes</i> is an immersive audiovisual experience in which the user shuffles through the history of suits, exploring their associations with the seasons, the elements, and human emotions. 

The main objectives of the suitscapes project are: 
- Create an immersive audiovisual experience
- Learn about facts and suits symbolism in an entertaining way

### Core Interactions - IN PROGRESS
- Facial expressions recognition: mouth and eyes recognition while immitating projected emotions
- Flip hand gesture while opening a deck
- Catch hand gesture (closed fist) while trying to cath an element

### User Journey
#### Content
- 4 Decks: Latin - Italian, Swiss-German (Jass), French and Hanafuda. We decided to integrate Hanafuda instead of Tarot, although it's not a 4-suits but a 12-suits card game (the 12 months of the four seasons), in order to present a non-european deck, with a less anthopocentric approach, and show that there are also different systems of suits
- Facts: Geographical origins, creation period, materiality, characteristics, fun facts, contemporary approach
- "Myths": seasons, natural elements and emotions symbolism  
- Chronological aspect: we are covering 4 different decks, representing quite different periods of time, based on their origins. We are not covering the whole chronological evolution of each deck and it's suits.
